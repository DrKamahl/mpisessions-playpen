A webservice to run MPISessions. Simply launch web.py to run the server (port 55001 by default).
The port can be changed by editting the last line of web.py.

The bin folder includes the necessary Z3 libraries required by MPISessions for every operating system.
If for some reason they aren't detected correctly, the bin folder needs to be placed in the system path.
